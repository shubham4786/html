        BMW Beginning in 1989, in response to harsh criticism from many groups, the bank began including environmental
        groups and NGOs in its loans to mitigate the past effects of its development policies that had prompted the
        criticism.[8]: 93–97  It also formed an implementing agency, in accordance with the Montreal Protocols, to stop
        ozone-depletion damage to the earth’s atmosphere by phasing out the use of 95% of ozone-depleting chemicals,
        with a target date of 2015. Since then, in accordance with its so-called “Six Strategic Themes”, the bank has
        put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development. For
        example, in 1991, the bank announced that to protect against deforestation, especially in the Amazon, it would
        not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment.

        Audi From 1974 to 1980, the bank concentrated on meeting the basic needs of people in the developing world. The size and number of loans to borrowers greatly increased, as loan targets expanded from infrastructure into social services and other sectors.[11]
        These changes can be attributed to Robert McNamara, who was appointed to the presidency in 1968 by Lyndon B. Johnson.[8]: 60–63  McNamara implored bank treasurer Eugene Rotberg to seek out new sources of capital outside of the northern banks that had been the primary sources of funding. Rotberg used the global bond market to increase the capital available to the bank.[12] One consequence of the period of poverty alleviation lending was the rapid rise of Third World debt. From 1976 to 1980, developing world debt rose at an average annual rate of 20%.[13][14]
        The World Bank Administrative Tribunal was established in 1980, to decide on disputes between the World Bank Group and its staff where allegation of non-observance of contracts of employment or terms of appointment had not been honored.[15]
